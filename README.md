# MRLN Token - ERC20 Vesting Contract for Project Merlin

**MRLN Token** is an ERC20-based vesting project designed to manage the release of tokens according to the tokenomics structure. This repository includes smart contracts that handle Token Generation Events (TGE), cliff periods, vesting schedules, and token sales.

## Overview

The MRLN Token ecosystem includes the following smart contracts:

1. **MRLNVesting**: Manages the vested release of MRLN tokens to specified addresses. These addresses, belonging to project owners, are assigned tokens based on different vesting schedules.
2. **MRLNPrivateSwap**: Handles private token sales, where users can purchase MRLN tokens at a fixed rate. Tokens are locked until the cliff period ends and then gradually released.
3. **MRLNStrategicSale**: Oversees strategic token sales conducted via private legal agreements. The project owner adds the buyer's address and token amount as a beneficiary to the contract.
